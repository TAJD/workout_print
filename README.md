# workout_print

The python script has a series of functions which allow me to generate a pdf describing my workout routine for the week coming. This is using the module pylatex.

The workout routine follows that presented [here](https://www.t-nation.com/training/8-6-3-for-size-and-strength) and is based around the four 'big lifts'; squat, press, deadlift and bench press. I have combined these with a series of accessory exercises. Usually these workouts take me between 50 minutes to an hour.
